# Bowling with Physics

## Introduction
Welcome to **Bowling with Physics**, a Unity game that simulates a realistic bowling experience using physics-based mechanics. This project expands on Unity's physics engine, scorekeeping, and UI management to create an engaging gameplay experience. 

## Features
- **Realistic Bowling Physics** – Simulates accurate ball rolling, pin collisions, and reactions.
- **Player Controls** – Move, aim, and release the ball with precision.
- **Cinemachine Camera** – Dynamic camera angles for immersive gameplay.
- **Scorekeeping System** – Tracks player scores based on fallen pins.
- **Game Management** – Resets pins and balls automatically for new rounds.
- **Trigger Colliders** – Gutter detection and invisible walls to ensure fair play.

## Technologies Used
- **Game Engine:** Unity
- **Programming Language:** C#
- **Camera System:** Cinemachine
- **Physics System:** Unity's Rigidbody & Colliders
- **UI System:** Unity UI

## Gameplay
1. Use the player controls to aim the ball.
2. Adjust power and direction.
3. Release the ball to knock down pins.
4. The game tracks scores automatically.
5. Reset the scene to start a new round.
